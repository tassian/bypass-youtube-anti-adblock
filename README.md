# Remove the Adblock Popup from Youtube
## Introduction

This repository contains a userscript that set the detection value of Youtubes new anti-adblock-system to false.  

## Usage

You need Tampermonkey (or another compatible) extension for your browser.
If you haven't already, you need to install the Tampermonkey browser extension. You can find it for various browsers:
   - [Tampermonkey for Opera/OperaGX](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)
   - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
   - [Tampermonkey for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)

1. **Open Tampermonkey Dashboard**:
   Click on the Tampermonkey extension icon in your browser and select "Dashboard."

2. **Create a New Script**:
   In the Tampermonkey Dashboard, click on the "Utilities" tab and select "Create a new script."

3. **Install the Script**:
   [Click Here and Press Install](https://github.com/tassian/bypass-youtube-anti-adblock/raw/main/bypass-anti-adblock.user.js).

4. **Enable the Script**:
   Enable the script by clicking the switch next to the script name in the Tampermonkey Dashboard.

### FYI

Opera seems to detect Tampermonkey as dangerous if you install it from the chrome webstore so use the opera addon store.
